# styled renaming

this mod allows you to use colours and other formatting when renaming items through the power of patbox's placeholder api! this mod uses [quicktext](https://placeholders.pb4.eu/user/quicktext/), which is easy-to-use and fully featured.

italics is also disabled when using quicktext, but can be brought back using the `<i>` tag.

examples:

- `<red>My Sword` becomes "<font color="#FF5555">My Sword</font>"
- `<c #d4c8ff><b>styled</> <c #f580ad>renaming` becomes "<font color="#d4c8ff"><b>styled</b></font> <font color="#f580ad">renaming</font>"

this mod needs [quilt loader](https://quiltmc.org/). if you're using fabric, you can switch over and keep all your mods!
